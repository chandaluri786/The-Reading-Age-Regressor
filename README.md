# The-Reading-Age-Regressor
This project explores the relationship between users' book rating behaviors and their demographic information, specifically age. By analyzing patterns in how users rate different books, we build predictive models that can estimate a user's age group or exact age using regression techniques.

## 🔍 Features

- **Data cleaning and preprocessing** of book rating datasets
- **Feature engineering** from user-book interactions
- **Multiple regression models** (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- **Hyperparameter tuning** and cross-validation
- **Model evaluation** and interpretation
- **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) of rating patterns
- **Feature importance analysis** to understand what drives predictions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning models and utilities
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Data visualization and plotting
  
## 📊 Dataset & Resources
- **Book-Crossing Dataset** - [Download from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/somnambwl/bookcrossing-dataset?resource=download)
  - Contains 278,858 users providing 1,149,780 ratings on 271,379 books
